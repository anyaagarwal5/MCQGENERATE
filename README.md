I developed an AI-powered tool that:
1️⃣ Summarizes academic notes to condense key concepts quickly.
2️⃣ Generates MCQs based on the summarized content to aid in assessments and self-evaluation.

⚙️ How It Works:

The system uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) models to process the uploaded notes.
Summaries are generated using advanced AI algorithms 🤖.
MCQs are created automatically, tailored to the content, ensuring relevance and accuracy 🎯.
🔧 Tech Stack:

Backend: Python 🐍, NLP libraries, and transformers.
Frontend: Intuitive user interface for seamless uploads and results 📤.
Deployment: Flask for integration and deployment 🌐.
Additional Tools: Integrated with Google Mini 1.5 Pro for enhanced processing speed and accuracy during the NLP stages ⚡.
